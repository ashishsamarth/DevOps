**Devops-Fundamentals**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dev-OPS Core Values :

    - Culture
    - Automation
    - Measurement
    - Sharing

a. What is Culture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier, teams in IT were split across 'Development' and 'Operations' with their focus split across 'Develop the Functionality' vs 'Maintainence of the system'. They often did not speak the same languauge in terms of day to day operations, and had different understanding.

b. What is Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea is to bring balance in to system in terms of People > Process > Tools and then evaluate if whatever you plan to automate reflects in to business values.

c. What is Measurement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its the metrics for evaluation of what is being done and it can be in multiple classifications
MTTR, Cycle Time, Costs, Revenue, Employee Satisfaction etc

d. What is Sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing ideas and problem is the core of DEV-OPS, engages collaboration and the feedback loop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dev-OPS Principles:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its often called - Three Ways Framework

a. Systems Thinking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tells us to focus on the overall outcome of the pipeline. Its easy to think about optimize certain modules of pipeline, but that should not deteriorate the over all productivity of the pipeline.

For E.g.: Increasing the performance of application by vertical scaling in the pipeline, may very well move the bottlenecks to other modules in the pipeline.

b. Amplifying feedback loop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating / shortening the feedback loop between multiple teams in the organization. Short effective feedback loop is very important for development & operations, since its impact on the time to resolution. Always evaluate, how many more feedback loops can be built in your ecosystem.

c. Continuous Experimentation & Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Master new skills with repetition and work with a 'Fail-Fast' mindset.
